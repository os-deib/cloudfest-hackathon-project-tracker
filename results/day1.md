# Day 1 Results

## Definition of goals
- **we will create a mvp for an inclusive language checker in WordPress and document our approach so that others can contribute to this and adapt it for other CMS**
- the plugin will highlight potentially problematic words within content that is edited on the block editor and make suggestions on why that word might not be an inclusive choice and what alternatives can be utilized
- we will provide documentation for the plugin and a way for future contributors to collaborate via GitHub, which will also be documented

## MVP features abd functionality
- a plugin for the wp blockeditor that can check content and provide feedback to the user and which can be installed on wordcamp.org
- the plugin should be added to the left and/or right sidebar and executed on autosave, if possible, or saving content manually. Both decisions are up to development to explore whether it is doable.
- the plugin will not prevent publishing content or change content for the user automatically, but just suggest improvements that can be applied by the users
- the relevant text element, which the plugin identified as potentially problematic, should be highlighted
- the mvp is limited to english language, but should be set up to allow adding more languages.
- a list of english language terms is created to be used for the MVP
- a user documentation for onboarding is created
- a contributor guide is created

## Results from day 1:
- the development team has split up tasks and set up a first prototype that is visible on the right sidebar and connected to the publish-button in wordpress content
- the list of words for the first iteration is still in progress, and will require further discussion
- workflows for contributors have been created

## Some features for the roadmap have been identified:
- different levels of checks to provide the right feedback to different target audicences
- support for other accessibility factors
- adding more languages
