# Results day 2

We have a working prototype! The first version of the plugin is working and can be tested at the end of day 2.

- We finished selecting words for the first import, and they were formatted for import to the plugin.
The github workflows for new issues now adds them to a backlog and adds a triage lable, so that they can be sorted by the project team.
- A landingpage was created by Birgit.
- Some text were generated for testing.
